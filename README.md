# a-transformer-impl

A manual implementation of an autoregressive transformer model in PyTorch.

Additional features and techniques (like LoRa) are added to the model.
All as a demonstration for basic implementation of these, aimed for better understanding of the concepts by viewing them at their simplest form.
